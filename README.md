# BrodBoost-C

BrodBoost-C is a breadboard power supply that connects via USB Type-C and delivers selectable 5 V and 3.3 V outputs. Its compact design minimizes the need for additional wiring, cable modifications, or bulky bench supplies. The device features independent voltage adjustments for each rail, a manual on/off switch, an LED indicator, and built-in fuse protection, making it a practical solution for projects using standard 2.54 mm breadboards. The 3.3 V regulator is based on the TPS63001, a switching step-down DC-DC converter.

BrodBoost-C is an open-source project, currently being [funded on Crowd-Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/axiometa/brodboost-c)
